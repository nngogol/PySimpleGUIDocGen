# PySimpleGUI
## Python GUIs For Humans - Transforms tkinter, Qt, Remi, WxPython into a people-friendly Pythonic interfaces
## (Non-humans.... PySimpleGUI-Feline port planned for 2020)

#### Looking for a GUI package?     Are you....

* looking to take your Python code from the world of command lines and into the convenience of a GUI? 
* sitting on a Raspberry **Pi** with a touchscreen that's going to waste because you don't have the time to learn a GUI SDK?
* into Machine Learning and are sick of the command line?
* an IT guy/gal that has written some cool tools but due to corporate policies are unable to share unless an EXE file?
* wanting to distribute your Python code to Windows users as a single .EXE file that launches straight into a GUI, much like a WinForms app?
* want to share your program with your friends or families (that aren't so freakish that they have Python running)
* wanting to run a program in your system tray?
* a teacher wanting to teach your students how to program using a GUI?
* a student that wants to put a GUI onto your project that will blow away your teacher?
* looking for a GUI package that is "supported" and is being constantly developed to improve it?
* longing for documentation and scores of examples?

**Look no further, you've found your GUI package**.

#### The basics

* Create windows that look and operate _identically_ to those created directly with tkinter, Qt, WxPython, and Remi.
* Requires 1/2 to 1/10th the amount of code as underlying frameworks.
* One afternoon is all that is required to learn the PySimpleGUI package _and_ write your first custom GUI.
* Students can begin using within their first week of Python education.
* No callback functions. You do not need to write the word `class` _anywhere_ in your code.
* Access to nearly every underlying GUI Framework's Widgets.
* Supports both Python 2.7 & 3 when using tkinter
* Supports both PySide2 and PyQt5 (limited support)
* Effortlessly move across tkinter, Qt, WxPython, and the Web (Remi) by changing only the import statement
* The *only* way to write both desktop and web based GUIs at the same time in Python
* Developed from nothing as a pure Python impelementation with Python friendly interfaces.
* Works with Qt Designer
* Built in Debugger
* Actively maintained and enhanced - 4 ports are underway, all being used by users.
* Corporate as well as home users.
* Appealing to both newcomers to Python and experiened Pythonistas. 
* The focus is entirely on the developer and making their life easier, simplified, and in control.

## GUI Development does not have to be difficult nor painful.  It can be FUN

#### What users are saying about PySimpleGUI
###### (None of these comments were solicited & are not paid endorsements - other than a huge thank you they received!)

"I've been working to learn PyQT for the past week in my off time as an intro to GUI design and how to apply it to my existing scripts... Took me ~30 minutes to figure out PySimpleGUI and get my scripts working with a GUI."

"Python has been an absolute nightmare for me and I've avoided it like the plague.  Until I saw PysimpleGUI."

"I've been pretty amazed at how much more intuitive it is than raw tk/qt. The dude developing it is super active on the project too so if you come across situations that you just can't get the code to do what you want you can make bug/enhancement issues that are almost assured to get a meaningful response."

"This library is the easiest way of gui programming in python! I'm totally in love with it ❤️"

"Wow that readme is extensive and great." (hear the love for docs often)

"Coming from R, Python is absolutely slick for GUIs. PySimpleGUI is a dream."

"I have been writing Python programs for about 4 or 5 months now. Up until this week I never had luck with any UI libraries like Tkinter, Qt, Kivy.  I went from not even being able to load a window in Tkinter reliably to making a loading screen, and full program in one night with PySimpleGUI."

"I love PySimpleGUI! I've been teaching it in my Python classes instead of Tkinter."

#### Python versions
As of 9/25/2018 **both Python 3 and Python 2.7 are supported** when using **tkinter version** of PySimpleGUI! The Python 3 version is named `PySimpleGUI`. The Python 2.7 version is `PySimpleGUI27`.  They are installed separately and the imports are different. See instructions in Installation section for more info.


# Platforms

## Hardware and OS Support

PySimpleGUI runs on Windows, Linux and Mac, just like tkinter, Qt, WxPython and Remi do.  If you can get the underlying GUI Framework installed / running on your machine then PySimpleGUI will also run there.

### Hardware

* PC's, Desktop, Laptops
* Macs of all types
* Raspberry Pi
* Android devices like phones and tablets

### OS

* Windows 7, 8, 10
* Linux on PC - Tested on **many** distributions
* Linux on Raspbnerry Pi
* Linux on Android - Must use either Termux or PyDroid3
* Mac OS (Sorry I don't know much about Macs)

## Output Devices

In addition to running as a desktop GUI, you can also run your GUI in a web browser by running PySimpleGUIWeb.  

This is ideal for "headless" setups like a Raspberry Pi that is at the core of a robot or other design that does not have a normal display screen.  For these devices, run a PySimpleGUIWeb program that never exits.  

Then connect to your application by going to the Pi's IP address (and port #) using a browser and you'll be in communication with your application.  You can use it to make configuration changes or even control a robot or other piece of hardward using buttons in your GUI

## A Complete PySimpleGUI Program (Getting The Gist)

Before diving into details, here's a description of what PySimpleGUI is/does and why that is so powerful.

You keep hearing "custom window" in this document because that's what you're making and using... your own custom windows.

Wouldn't it be nice if a GUI with 3 "rows" of Widgets (Elements) was defined in 3 lines of code?  That's exactly how it's done.  Each row of Elements are a list.  Put all those lists together and you've got a window.

What about handling button clicks and stuff.  That's 5 lines of the code below beginning with the while loop.  

Now look at the `layout` variable and then look at the window graphic below.  Defining a window is taking a design you can see visually and then visually creating it in code.  One row of Elements = 1 line of code (can span more if your window is crouded)

This makes the coding process extremely quick and the amount of code very small

```python
import PySimpleGUI as sg
# All the stuff inside your window. This is the PSG magic code compactor...
layout = [  [sg.Text('Some text on Row 1')],
            [sg.Text('Enter something on Row 2'), sg.InputText()],
            [sg.OK(), sg.Cancel()]]

# Create the Window
window = sg.Window('Window Title', layout)
# Event Loop to process "events"
while True:             
    event, values = window.Read()
    print(event, values)
    if event in (None, 'Cancel'):
        break

window.Close()
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/61077153-cdfc0b00-a3eb-11e9-9e93-d6ec2ffb442a.png)

You gotta admit that the code above is a lot more "fun" looking that tkinter code you've studied before.  Adding stuff to your GUI is trivial.  You can clearly see the "mapping" of those 3 lines of code to specific Elements laid out in a Window.   It's not a trick.  It's how easy it is to code in PySimpleGUI.  

It's a thrill to complete your GUI project way ahead of what you estimated.  Some people take that extra time to polish their GUI to make it even nicer, adding more bells and whistles because it's so easy and it's a lot of fun to see success after success as you write your program.




## The Underlying GUI Frameworks

At the moment there are 4 acitvely developed and maintained "ports" of PySimpleGUI.  These include:
1. tkinter - Fully complete
2. Qt using Pyside2 - Alpha stage.  Not all features for all Elements are done
3. WxPython - Development stage, pre-releaser.  Not all Elements are done. Some known problems with multiple windows
4. Remi (Web browser support) - Development stage, pre-release.


While PySimpleGUI, the tkinter port, is the only 100% completed version of PySimpleGUI, the other 3 ports have a LOT of functionality in them and are in active use by a large portion of the installations.  You can see the number of Pip installs at the very top of this document to get a comparison as to the size of the install base for each port.  The "badges" are right after the logo.


# The PySimpleGUI "Family"

## What's The Big Deal? What is it?

PySimpleGUI wraps tkinter, Qt, WxPython and Remi so that you get all the same widgets, but you interact with them in a more friendly way.  It does the layout and boilerplate code for you and presents you with a **simple, efficient interface.**  

If you've done GUI programming, you're going to love this.  Instead of 6 lines of code, you can write what you want to do in a single line.

### Quick example
 A bit of text to show in your window.  It takes 1 line of PySimpleGUI code to both create the "Label" Widget but also to color and size it the right way.  Or maybe you want to be informed when someone clicks on the text.  Or you change the font size, bold it.  It's all still 1 line of PySimpleGUI code.  `Label` is what many GUI packages call Text.  PySimpleGUI sticks with `Text` across all the ports.

 You can bet all of those items listed take more than 1 line to change in the underlying GUI framework.  Just setting the color of the text can take 3 lines in some ports.  PySimpleGUI does all of those calls on your behalf, leaving you with specifying them in an easy to understand and Python friendly way.

This is what a line of PySimpleGUI code looks like when you create your window's contents.
 ```python
 Text('This is some text', font='Helvetica 12', text_color='blue', background_color='green')
 ```

Creating windows with Elements in the right places is easy with PySimpleGUI.  You can create layouts that are completely custom using exactly the same kind of containers and GUI constructs that you would use if you wrote directly to the underlying SDK.  They just happen to have all be "standardized" across all 4 current ports.

## The "Ports"

There are distinct ports happening as mentioned above.  Each have their own location on GitHub under the main project.  They have their own Readme with is an *augmentation* of this document... they are meant to be used together.

PySimpleGUI is released on PyPI as 5 distinct packages.
1. PySimpleGUI - tkinter version
2. PySimpleGUI27 - tkinter version that runs on 2.7
3. PySimpleGUIWx - WxPython version
4. PySimpleGUIQt - PySided2 version
5. PySimpleGUIWeb - The web (Remi) version

You will need to install them separately

There is also an accompanying debugger known as `imwatchingyou`.  If you are running the tkinter version of PySimpleGUI, you will not need to install the debugger as there is a version embedded directly into PySimpleGUI.

## Qt Version


Qt was the second port after tkinter.  It is the 2nd most complete with the original PySimpleGUI (tkinter) being the most complete and is likely to continue to be the front-runner.

As mentioned previously each port has an area.  For Qt, you can learn more on the [PySimpleGUIQt GitHub site](https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/PySimpleGUIQt).  **There is a separate Readme file for the Qt version** that you'll find there.  This is true for all of the PySimpleGUI ports.

Give it a shot if you're looking for something a bit more "modern".  PySimpleGUIQt is currently in Alpha.  All of the widgets are operational but some may not yet be full-featured.  If one is missing and your project needs it, log an Issue.  It's how new features are born.

Here is a summary of the Qt Elements with no real effort spent on design clearly.  It's an example of the "test harness" that is a part of each port. If you run the PySimpleGUI.py file itself then you'll see one of these tests.

As you can see, you've got a full array of GUI Elements to work with.  All the standard ones are there in a single window.  So don't be fooled into thinking PySimpleGUIQt is barely working or doesn't have many widgets to choose from.

## WxPython Version

[PySimpleGUIWx GitHub site](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/PySimpleGUIWx).  **There is a separate Readme file for the WxPython version**.

Started in late December 2018 PySimpleGUIWx started with the SystemTray Icon feature.    This enabled the package to have one fully functioning feature that can be used along with tkinter to provide a complete program.    The System Tray feature is complete and working very well.  It was used not long ago in a corporate setting and has been performing perfectly.

The Windowing code was coming together with Reads operational which means Popups work.  The elements were getting completed on a regular basis. But I ran into multiwindow problems.  And it was at about this time that Remi was suggested as a port.

Remi (the "web port") overnight lept the WxPython effort and Web became a #1 priority and continues to be.  The thought is that the desktop was well represented with PySimpleGUI, PySimpleGUIQt, and PySimpleGUIWx.  Between those ports is a solid winowing system and 2 system tray implementations and a nearly feature complete Qt effort.  So, the team was switched over.

## Web Version (Remi)

[PySimpleGUIWeb GitHub site](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/PySimpleGUIWeb).  **There is a separate Readme file for the Web version**.

New for 2019, PySimpleGUIWeb.  This is an exciting development!  PySimpleGUI in your Web Browser!

The underlying framework supplying the web capability is the Python package Remi.  https://github.com/dddomodossola/remi  Remi provides the widgets as well as a web server for you to connect to.  It's an exiting new platform to be running on and has temporarily bumped the WxPython port from the highest priority.  PySimpleGUIWeb is the current high priority project.

Use this solution for your Pi projects that don't have anything connected in terms of input devices or display.  Run your Pi in "headless" mode and then access it via the Web interface.  This allows you to easily access and make changes to your Pi without having to hook up anything to it.


## Source code compatibility

Your source code is completely portable from one platform to another by simply changing the import statement.  That's the GOAL and if OFTEN the case.  I've been stunned how many times thins works.  Seeing your code run on tkinter, then change the import to `import  PySimpleGUIWeb as sg` and instead of a tkinter window, up pops Chrome with your window running in there instead.

What does this mean?  It means it takes a trivial amount of effort to move across GUI Frameworks.  Don't like the way your GUI looks on tkinter?  No problem, change over to try PySimpleGUIQt.  Made a nice desktop app but want to bring it to the web too?  Again, no problem, use PySimpleGUIWeb

# repl.it Version

***Want to really get your mind blown?***  Check out this [PySimpleGUI program](https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUIWeb-Demos) running in your web browser.

Thanks to the magic of repl.it and Remi it's possible to run PySimpleGUI code in a browser window without having Python running on your computer.

The programs you write using repl.it will automatically download and install the latest PySimpleGUIWeb from PyPI onto a virtual Python environment.  All that is required is to type `import PySimpleGUIWeb` you'll have a Python environment up and running with the latest PyPI release of PySimpleGUIWeb.

This is an exciting new development that's opening up all kinds of possibilities for new ways to program and learn PySimpleGUI.   Stayed tuned, much more to be posted about this in the near future.

Educators in particular should be interested.  Students can not only post their homework easily for their teacher to access, but teachers can also run the students programs online.  No downloading needed.  Run it and check the results.

Depending on how you're viewing this document, you may or may not see an embedded browser window below that is running PySimpleGUI code.  

Not only can you run PySimpleGUIWeb code using repl.it, they have a tkinter library version.  You can see a tkinter (a PySimpleGUI window) in a browser using repl.it.

# Support

PySimpleGUI is an active project.  Bugs are fixed, features are added, often.  Should you run into trouble, open an issue on the [GitHub site](http://www.PySimpleGUI.com) and you'll receive help.  Posting questions on StackOverflow, Forums, Mailing lists, Reddit, etc, is not the fastest path to support and taking it may very well lead you astray as folks not familiar with the package struggle to help you.

So, [open an Issue](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/issues/new/choose), choose "custom form" and fill it out completely.  There are very good reasons behind all of the questions.  Cutting corners only cuts your changes of getting help and getting quality help as it's difficult enough to debug remotely.  Don't handicap people that want to help by not providing enough information.

Be sure and run your program outside of your IDE *first*.  Start your program from the shell using `python` or `python3` command.  On numerous occassions much time was spent chasing problems caused by the IDE.  By running from a command line, you take that whole question out of the problem, an important step.

### PySimpleGUI Trolls

Yea, they're out there.  Would have NEVER in a billion years guessed that there would be objection, coming from a small, but vocal, number of people.  I naively believed everyone would be supportive, see the value, hold hands around the fire, sing songs, and in the very least be truthful.  But, this ain't Kansas and the Internet is...  WTF is it with people?

If someone is actively discouraging you from using this package, then know you are on the right track and you should give it a try.  

I promise you're not going to be wrecked for life.  It will not ruin your career.  It's not going to teach you bad habits.  One person I know got a bonus based on a PySimpleGUI program he wrote. I promise you WILL see a GUI in 5 minutes.  And you could see some pretty cool stuff running in a GUI by grabbing the GitHub and start running and hacking on files.

### Target Audience

The 80% of GUI users on Python that PySimpleGUI fits.  The other 20% go straight onto Qt or WxPython, or whoever fills that need.

Still with me? 

PySimpleGUI is designed with both the bgeinner and the experienceed developer in mind.  Why?  Because both tend to like compact code as much as I do.  Most like simple sh\*t.  We just want to get sh\*t done, right?  No, you like the existing GUI architectures (they're all roughly the same, except this one), go join the 20% club just down the street.  There's plenty of room for you there.

#### Beginners

There are a couple of reasons beginners could have stopped in for a peek.  The first is to simply throw a simple GUI onto the front of an existing command line application.  Or maybe you need to popup a box to get a filename.  These can often be simple 1-line `Popup` calls.

If you have a more intricate, complete, perhaps multi-window design in mind, then PySimpleGUI still could be your best choice.

This package is not only great to use as your first GUI package, but it also teaches how to design and utilize a GUI.  In fact, it does it better than any existing GUI.  Why?  Because it removes the classes, callback functions, object oriented design to better get out of your way and let you focus entirely on your GUI and not how to represent it in code.  The result is 1/2 to 1/10 th the amount of code that implements the exact same layout and widgets as you would get from coding yourself directly in Qt5.

Forget syntax completely and just look on the overall activities of a PySimpleGUI programmer.  You have to design your window.... determine your inputs and your outputs, place buttons in strategic places, create menus, .... You'll be busy just doing all those things to design and define your GUI completely independent upon the underlying framework. 

#### Advanced Programmers, Code Slingers

It's not perfect, but PySimpleGUI is an amazing bit of technology. 

As mentioned, ou really can write both a desktop and a web application at the same time, among other things.

What I hear from seasoned professionals is that PySimpleGUI saves them a **ton** of time.  They've written GUI code before.  They know how to lay out a window.  These folks just want to get their window working and quick.

With the help of IDE's like PyCharm, Visual STudio and Wing (the offically supported list) you get instant documentation on the calls you are making.  On PyCharm you instantly see both the call signature but also the explanations about each parameter.

Because PySimpleGUI has so many parameters to element creation calls, you really need this level of integration between code and documentation to be able to work quickly.

If the screenshots, demo programs and documentation don't convince you to at least **give it a try, once**, then you're way too busy, or .....  I dunno, I stopped guessing "why?" some time ago.  Some of the most reluctant of people to try PySimpleGUI have turned out to be some of the biggest supporters.

-----

## Macs

It's surprising that Python GUI code is completely cross platform from Windows to Mac to Linux.  No source code changes.  This is true for both  PySimpleGUI and PySimpleGUIQt.

However, **Macs** suck.  They suck on tkinter in particular.  The "Look and feel" calls are disabled for Macs.  Colored buttons in particular are broken.  Not in the PySimpleGUI code, of course.  Consider using Qt instead of tkinter on the Mac.  Or, if using tkinter, bring your own button images.  

I suggest looking through the open and closed issues if you're a  Mac person with a problem.

*Switching to "Light Mode" is known to fix some of the problems.*  They honestly are tkinter/Mac problems.

-------------------

# Learning Resources

The initial "get up and running" portion of PySimpleGUI should take you less than 5 minutes.  The goal is 5 minutes from your decision "I'll give it a try" to having your first window up on the screen "Oh wow, it was that easy?!" in 5 minutes or less.

The primary learning pathes for PySimpleGUI are:
 * This readme document over 100 pages of PySimpleGUI answers
 * The Cookbook - Recipes to get you going
 * The Demo Programs - Start hacking on one of these running soluitions
 * The YouTube videos - If you like instructional videos, there are 15 videos

 Everything is geared towards giving you a "quick start" whether that be a Recipe or a Demo Program.  The idea is to give you something running and let you hack away at it.  As a developer this saves tremendous amounts of time.

 You **start** with a working program, a GUI on the screen.  Then have at it.

 A high percentage of users report both learning PySimpleGUI and completing their project in a single day.  This isn't a rare event at all.  GUI programming doesn't HAVE to be difficult by definition and PySimpleGUI has certainly made it much much more approachable.

## This Readme and Cookbook

The readme and Cookbook are best viewed on ReadTheDocs.  The quickest way there is to visit:
http://www.PySimpleGUI.org

You will be auto-forwarded to the right destination.  There are multiple tabs on ReadTheDocs.  One for the main readme and one for the Cookbook.  There are other documents there like an architectural design doc

The Cookbook has approx 27 "Recipes" or short programs that can be easily copied and pastedThe addition of MANY embedded frames of repl.it frames has slowed down the page.  I'm questioning the decision to add those embedded frames and may soon remove them.

## Demo Programs

The GitHub repo has the Demo Programs.  There are ones built for plain PySimpleGUI that are usually portrable to other versions of PySimpleGUI.  And there are some that are associated with one of the other ports.  The easiest way to the GitHub:
http://www.PySimpleGUI.com

As of this writing, on 2019-07-10 there are 177 Demo Programs for you to choose from.  

These programs demonstrate to you how to use the Elements and especially how to integtate PySimpleGUI with some of the popular open source technologies such as OpenCV, PyGame, PyPlot, and Matplotlib to name a few.


---

# The Quick Tour

Let's take a super-brief tour around PySimpleGUI.  There are 2 levels of windowing support in PySimpleGUI -  High Level and Customized.

The high-level calls are those that perform a lot of work for you. These are not custom made windows (those are the other way of interacting with PySimpleGUI).

Let's use one of these high level calls, the `Popup` and use it to create our first window, the obligatory "Hello World".  It's a single line of code.  You can use these calls like print statements, adding as many parameters and types as you desire.

```python
import PySimpleGUI as sg

sg.Popup('Hello From PySimpleGUI!', 'This is the shortest GUI program ever!')
```

Or how about a ***custom GUI*** in 1 line of code?  No kidding this is a valid program and it uses Widgets like you normally would in a tkinter program.  It's just been compacted together is all, strictly for demonstration purposes as there's no need to go that extreme in compactness, unless you have a reason to and then you can be thankful you can.

```python
import PySimpleGUI as sg

event, values = sg.Window('Get filename example', [[sg.Text('Filename')], [sg.Input(), sg.FileBrowse()], [sg.OK(), sg.Cancel()] ]).Read()
```

![get filename](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/44960039-f1018880-aec5-11e8-8a43-3d7f8ff93b67.jpg)

# Polishing Your Windows = Building "Beautiful Windows"

Your window does not have to look like the boring gray window used in the above example.

So many posts on Reddit asking which GUI is going to result in a "beautiful window", as if there's a magic GUI library that pretties things up for you.  

Beautiful windows are created, not simply given to you.  There are people that design and create artwork for user interfaces, you know that right?  Artists draw buttons, artwork that you include in the window to make it nicer.

These 2 windows are running on top of tkinter.  They've been polished and I'm sure they could be polished even further as I'm no artist nor UI expert.

# Pi Windows

Perhaps you're looking for a way to interact with your **Raspberry Pi** in a more friendly way.  Your PySimpleGUI code will run on a Pi with no problem.  Tkinter is alive and well on the Pi platform.  The controls are a little cruder looking due to the size of the screen, etc.  You could add custom artwork, etc to make it look nicer.

This is simply an example of the many GUI Elements that are available to use on all platforms.

# Games

It's possible to create some cool games by simply using the built-in PySimpleGUI graphic primivites like those used in this game of pong.  PyGame can also be embedded into a PySimpleGUI window and code is provided to you demonstrating how.


![pong](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/45860012-2d8d0b00-bd33-11e8-9efd-3eaf4c30f324.gif)


# Windows Programs That Look Like Windows Programs

Do you have the desite to share your code with other people in your department, or with friends and family?  Many of them may not have Python on their computer.  And in the corporate environment, it may not be possible for you to install Python on their computer.

`PySimpleGUI + PyInstaller` to the rescue!!

Combining PySimpleGUI with PyInstaller creates something truly remarkable and special, a Python program that looks like a Windows WinForms application.  

The application you see below with a working menu was created in 20 lines of Python code.  It is a single .EXE file that launches straight into the screen you see.  And more good news, the only icon you see on the taskbar is the window itself... there is no pesky shell window.  Nice, huh? 

![menu demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/45923097-8fbc4c00-beaa-11e8-87d2-01a5331811c8.gif)


With a simple GUI, it becomes practical to "associate" .py files with the python interpreter on Windows.  Double click a py file and up pops a GUI window, a more pleasant experience than opening a dos Window and typing a command line.

# Background

Feel free to skip all this if you don't care to know the backstory and reasons behind decisions.

I was frustrated by having to deal with the dos prompt when I had a powerful Windows machine right in front of me.  Why is it SO difficult to do even the simplest of input/output to a window in Python??

There was a project looming and a GUI was needed.  Thus began a search for a simplified GUI package that would enable me to work with tkinter easier.  I found a few, and they were pretty popular too, but they lacked the full-compliment of Widgets and it was impossible to define my own window using those widgets.

A whacky idea came to mind... what if I wrote a simplified GUI and then used THAT to write my application.  It would be a lot less code and it would be "easy" to write my application then.

Thus PySimpleGUI was born out of necessity and it's been the necessity of others that have helped evolve it into the package it is today.  It would not be 1/2 as good without the help of the community.

Once PySimpleGUI was done, it was time to start working on "the ports".  And, of course, also this documentation.

## Foused on You, the Developer

The `PySimpleGUI` package is focused on the ***developer***.  

The overarching goals of PySimpleGUI were

> Create a custom GUI with as little and as simple code as possible.

and

> "Do it in a Python-like way"

### The Non-OO and Non-Event-Driven Model

How do you make a GUI interface easy enough for first year Python students?  Heck, first WEEK of Python was the actual goal and it still is. This meant classes could be used to build and use it, but classes can not be part of the code the user writes.  Of course, an OO design is quite possible to use with PySimpleGUI, but it's not a requirement.  The sample code and docs stay away from writing new classes for the most part.

What about those pesky callbacks?  They're difficult for beginners to grasp and they're a bit of a pain in the ass to deal with.  The way PySimpleGUI got around events was to build a "message passing" architecture instead.  

Instead of a user function being called when there's some event, instead the information is "passed" to the user when they call the function `Window.Read()` Everything is returned through this call.  The callbacks still happen, but they all happen inside of PySimpleGUI where they are turned into messages to pass ot you.

### The Result

A GUI that's appealing to a broad audience that is customizable, easy to program, and is solid with few bugs and rarely crashes (99% of the time user error).

PySimpleGUI is becoming more and more popular. The number of installs and the number of successes grows daily.

The number of ports is up to 4.  The number of integrations with other technologies is constantly being expanded.  It's a great time to try PySimpleGUI!

# Features

While simple to use, PySimpleGUI has significant depth to be explored by more advanced programmers.  The feature set goes way beyond the requirements of a beginner programmer, and into the  required features needed for complex GUIs.

For those of you that have heard PySimpleGUI is only good for doing the most simplest of GUIs, this feature list should put that myth to rest.  **The SIMPLE part of PySimpleGUI is how much effort _you_ expend to write a GUI.  Not the complexity of the program.**  It's literally "simple" to do... it is not limited to simple problems.

Features of PySimpleGUI include:

- Support for Python versions 2.7 and 3

## Design Goals

With the developer being the focus, the center of it all, it was important to keep this mindset at all times, including now, today.  Why is this such a big deal?  Because this package was written so that the universe of Python applications can grow and can **include EVERYONE into the GUI tent.**  

> Beginers and Advanted Together

Design an interface that both the complete beginner can understand and use that has enough depth that an advanced programmer can make some very nice looking GUIs.

> Success After Success

Success after success.... this is the model that will win developer's hearts.  This is what users love about PySimpleGUI.

> Up in 5 minutes

Success #1 has to happen immediately.  Installing and then running your first GUI program.  FIVE minutes is the target.

> Copy, Paste, Run.

The Cookbook and Demo Programs are there to fulfill this goal.  First get the user seeing on their screen a working GUI that's similar in some way to what they want to create.  Seeing your webcam running in the middle of a GUI window is quite a thrill if you're developing OpenCV software and that's exactly what you'll see when you run the OpenCV Demo Programs.


> Be Pythonic

Be Pythonic... 

This one was difficult for me to define.

I ended up defining it as - attempted to use language constructs in a natural way and to exploit some of Python's interesting features.  Python's lists and optional parameters make PySimpleGUI work smoothly.

- windows are represented as Python lists.
- A window is a list of rows
- A row is a list of elements
- Return values are a list/dictionary of button presses and input values.
- The SDK calls collapse down into a single line of Python code that presents a custom GUI and returns values should you want that extreme of a bit of code.
- Elements are all classes. Users interact with elements using class methods but are not required to write their own classes.

#### Lofty Goals

>  Change Python

The hope is not that ***this*** package will become part of the Python Standard Library.  The hope is that Python will become ***the*** go-to language for creating GUI programs that run on Windows, Mac, and Linux *for all levels of developer*.  Perhaps this sort of package is needed to make that happen.

> Capture Budding Graphic Designers

The hope is that beginners that are interested in graphic design, and are taking a Python course, will have an easy way to express themselves, right from the start of their Python experience.  Even if they're not the best programmers they will be able to show custom GUI layouts with ease.

> Fill the GUI Gap

There is a noticeable gap in the Python GUI solution.  Fill that gap and who knows what will happen.  At the moment, to make a tradiional GUI window using tkinter, Qt, WxPython and Remi, it takes much more than a week, or a month of Python education to use these GUI packages.  

They are out of reach of the beginners.  Often WAY out of reach.  And yet, time and time again, beginners that say they JUST STARTED with Python will ask on a Forum or Reddit for a GUI pacakage recommendation.  9 times out of 10 Qt is recommended.  (smacking head with hand).  What a waste of characters.

> Is There a There?

Maybe there's no "there there".  ***Or*** maybe a simple GUI API will enable Python to dominate yet another computing discipline like it has so many others.  This is one attempt to find out.


# Getting Started with PySimpleGUI

## Installing PySimpleGUI

### IDEs

Some IDEs provide virtual environments.  PyCharm is one example.  For these, you will either use their GUI interface to add packages or use their built-in terminal to do pip installs.

#### Officially Supported IDEs

A number of IDEs have **known problems with PySimpleGUI**.  IDLE and Spyder both have problems with intermittent or inconsistent results, especially when a program exits.

The official list is:
1. PyCharm (or course this is THE IDE to use for use with PySimpleGUI)
2. Wing
3. Visual Studio



### Installing on Python 3

`pip install --upgrade PySimpleGUI`

On some systems you need to run pip3. (Linux and Mac)

`pip3 install --upgrade PySimpleGUI`

On a Raspberry Pi, this is should work:

`sudo pip3 install --upgrade pysimplegui`

Some users have found that upgrading required using an extra flag on the pip `--no-cache-dir`.

`pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir PySimpleGUI`

On some versions of Linux you will need to first install pip.  Need the Chicken before you can get the Egg (get it... Egg?)

`sudo apt install python3-pip`

`tkinter` is a requirement for PySimpleGUI (the only requirement).  Some OS variants, such as Ubuntu, do not some with `tkinter` already installed.  If you get an error similar to:

`ImportError: No module named tkinter`

then you need to install `tkinter`.

For python 2.7

`sudo apt-get install python-tk`

For python 3
`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

More information about installing tkinter can be found here: https://www.techinfected.net/2015/09/how-to-install-and-use-tkinter-in-ubuntu-debian-linux-mint.html


### Installing for Python 2.7

`pip install --upgrade PySimpleGUI27`
or
`pip2 install --upgrade PySimpleGUI27`

You may need to also install "future" for version 2.7

`pip install future`
or
`pip2 install future`

Python 2.7 support is relatively new and the bugs are still being worked out.  I'm unsure what may need to be done to install tkinter for Python 2.7.  Will update this readme when more info is available

Like above, you may have to install either pip or tkinter.  To do this on Python 2.7:

`sudo apt install python-pip`

`sudo apt install python-tkinter`

### Testing your installation

Once you have installed, or copied the .py file to your app folder, you can test the installation using python.  At the command prompt start up Python.

#### Instructions for Python 2.7:
```python
>>> import PySimpleGUI27
>>> PySimpleGUI27.main()
```

#### Instructions for Python 3:

```python3
>>> import PySimpleGUI
>>> PySimpleGUI.main()
```

You will see a "test harness" that exercises the SDK, tells you the version number, allows you to try 

### Finding Out Where Your PySimpleGUI Is Coming From

Sometimes when debugging, questions arise as to exactly which PySimpleGUI you are running.  The quick way to find this out is to again, run Python from the command line.  This time you'll type:


```python3
>>> import PySimpleGUI as sg
>>> sg
```

When you type sg, Python will tell you the full patch to your PySimpleGUI file / package.  This is critical information to know when debugging because it's really easy to forget you've got an old copy of PySimpleGUI laying around somewhere.

### Manual installation

If you're not connected to the net on your target machine, or pip isn't working, or you want to run the latest code from GitHub, then all you have to do is place the single PySimpleGUI source file `PySimpleGUI.py` (for tkinter port) and place it in your application's folder (the folder where the py file is that imports PySimpleGUI).  Your application will load that local copy of PySimpleGUI as if it were a package.

Be ***sure*** that you delete this PySimpleGUI.py file if you install a newer pip version.  Often the sequence of events is that a bug you've reported was fixed and checked into GitHub.  You download the PySimpleGUI.py file (or the appropriately named one for your port) and put with your app.  Then later your fix is posted with a new release on PyPI.  You'll want to delete the GitHub one before you install from pip.

### Prerequisites
Python 2.7 or Python 3
tkinter

PySimpleGUI Runs on all Python3 platforms that have tkinter running on them.  It has been tested on Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi.  Even runs on `pypy3`.

### EXE file creation

If you wish to create an EXE from your PySimpleGUI application, you will need to install `PyInstaller`.  There are instructions on how to create an EXE at the bottom of this document.


## Using  - Python 3

To use in your code, simply import....
`import PySimpleGUI as sg`

Then use either "high level" API calls or build your own windows.

`sg.Popup('This is my first Popup')`

![first popup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/44957300-c7813680-ae9e-11e8-9a8c-c70198db7907.jpg)


Yes, it's just that easy to have a window appear on the screen using Python.  With PySimpleGUI, making a custom window appear isn't much more difficult.  The goal is to get you running on your GUI within ***minutes***, not hours nor days.

## Using  - Python 2.7

Those using Python 2.7 will import a different module name
`import PySimpleGUI27 as sg`

## Code to Automatically Import Correct Version

Many of the demo programs use this check to see which package to use:
```python
import sys
if sys.version_info[0] >= 3:
    import PySimpleGUI as sg
else:
    import PySimpleGUI27 as sg
```


This will automatically import the correct library based on the Python version number reported by the Python interpreter.

# APIs

PySimpleGUI can be broken down into 2 types of API's:
* High Level single call functions    (The `Popup` calls)
	* Popups - Get a window with a varierty of buttons and options pre-defined
	* SingleLineProgressMeters - drop into a loop and you're done
	* Debug `print` statements that go to a debug window
* Custom windows with Elements
* System Tray Applications (in Qt and WxPython ports)


### Python Language Features

There are a number of Python language features that PySimpleGUI utilizes heavily for API access that should be understood...
* Variable number of arguments to a call
* Optional parameters to calls
* Named parameters to calls
* Dictionaries - values returned as
* None - Used to indicate blank setting or window close event

#### Variable Number of Arguments

The "High Level" API calls that *output* values take a variable number of arguments so that they match a "print" statement as much as possible.  The idea is to make it simple for the programmer to output as many items as desired and in any format.  The user need not convert the variables to be output into the strings.  The PySimpleGUI functions do that for the user.

sg.Popup('Variable number of parameters example', var1, var2, "etc")

Each new item begins on a new line in the Popup

![snap0179](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43658129-f6ca49c6-9725-11e8-9317-1f77443eb04a.jpg)


#### Optional Parameters to a Function Call

This feature of the Python language is utilized ***heavily*** as a method of customizing windows and window Elements.  Rather than requiring the programmer to specify every possible option for a widget, instead only the options the caller wants to override are specified.

Here is the function definition for the Popup function. The details aren't important.  What is important is seeing that there is a long list of potential tweaks that a caller can make.  However, they don't *have* to be specified on each and every call.

```python
def Popup(*args,
		   button_color=None,
		   button_type=MSG_BOX_OK,
		   auto_close=False,
		   auto_close_duration=None,
		   icon=DEFAULT_WINDOW_ICON,
		   line_width=MESSAGE_BOX_LINE_WIDTH,
		   font=None):
```

If the caller wanted to change the button color to be black on yellow, the call would look something like this:
`sg.Popup('This box has a custom button color', button_color=('black', 'yellow'))`

![snap0180](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/43658171-13a72bfe-9726-11e8-8c7a-0a46e46fb202.jpg)

#### Dictionaries

You'll know that dictionaries are being used if you see a `key` parameter on any Element.  

Dictionaries are used in 2 ways:
1. To identify values when a `window.Read` call is made
2. To identify Elements with `keys` so that they can be identified uniquely and modified
