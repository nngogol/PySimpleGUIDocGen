## Release Notes
2.3 - Sliders, Listbox's and Image elements (oh my!)

If using Progress Meters, avoid cancelling them when you have another window open.  It could lead to future windows being blank. It's being worked on.

New debug printing capability.  `sg.Print`

2.5 Discovered issue with scroll bar on `Output` elements.  The bar will match size of ROW not the size of the element.  Normally you never notice this due to where on a form the `Output` element goes.

Listboxes are still without scrollwheels. The mouse can drag to see more items.  The mouse scrollwheel will also scroll the list and will `page up` and `page down` keys.

2.7 Is the "feature complete" release. Pretty much all features are done and in the code

2.8 More text color controls.  The caller has more control over things like the focus and what buttons should be clicked when enter key is pressed. Return values as a dictionary! (NICE addition)

2.9 COLUMNS!  This is the biggest feature and had the biggest impact on the code base.  It was a difficult feature to add, but it was worth it.  Can now make even more layouts. Almost any layout is possible with this addition.

.................. insert releases 2.9 to 2.30 .................

3.0 We've come a long way baby!  Time for a major revision bump.  One reason is that the numbers started to confuse people  the latest release was 2.30, but some people read it as 2.3 and thought it went backwards.  I kinda messed up the 2.x series of numbers, so why not start with a clean slate.  A lot has happened anyway so it's well earned.

One change that will set PySimpleGUI apart is the parlor trick of being able to move the window by clicking on it anywhere.  This is turned on by default.  It's not a common way to interact with windows.  Normally you have to move using the titlebar.  Not so with PySimpleGUI.  Now you can drag using any part of the window.  You will want to turn off for windows with sliders.  This feature is enabled in the Window call.

Related to the Grab Anywhere feature is the no_titlebar option, again found in the call to Window.  Your window will be a spiffy, borderless window.  It's a really interesting effect.  Slight problem is that you do not have an icon on the taskbar with these types of windows, so if you don't supply a button to close the window, there's no way to close it other than task manager.

3.0.2 Still making changes to Update methods with many more ahead in the future.  Continue to mess with grab anywhere option.  Needed to disable in more places such as the PopupGetText function.  Any time these is text input on a form, you generally want to turn off the grab anywhere feature.

#### 3.2.0
 Biggest change was the addition of the Table Element.  Trying to make changes so that form resizing is a possibility but unknown if will work in the long run.  Removed all MsgBox, Get* functions and replaced with Popup functions.  Popups had multiple new parameters added to change the look and feel of a popup.

#### 3.3.0
OneLineProgressMeter function added which gives you not only a one-line solution to progress meters, but it also gives you the ability to have more than 1 running at the same time, something not possible with the EasyProgressMeterCall

#### 3.4.0

* Frame - New Element - a labelled frame for grouping elements. Similar
   to Column
* Graph (like a Canvas element except uses the caller's
   coordinate system rather than tkinter's).
* initial_folder - sets starting folder for browsing type buttons (browse for file/folder).
* Buttons return  key value rather than button text **If** a `key` is specified,
*
   OneLineProgressMeter!  Replaced EasyProgressMeter (sorry folks that's
   the way progress works sometimes)

    * Popup
    * PopupGetFolder
    * PopupGetFile

* Combobox - Can set value to an Index into the Values table rather than the Value itself
* Warnings added to Drawing routines for Graph element (rather than crashing)
* Window - can "force top level" window to be used rather than a normal window.  Means that instead of calling Tk to get a window, will call TopLevel to get the window
* Window Disable / Enable - Disables events (button clicks, etc) for a Window.  Use this when you open a second window and want to disable the first window from doing anything. This will simulate a 'dialog box'
* Tab Group returns a value with Window is Read.  Return value is the string of the selected tab
* Turned off grab_anywhere for Popups
* New parameter, default_extension, for PopupGetFile
* Keyboard shortcuts for menu items. Can hold ALT key to select items in men

* PopupScrolled - Added back using CloseButton to close the window
* Fixed PopupGetFolder to use correct PySimpleGUI program constructs (keys)
* PopupGetText populated values carrectly using the value variable, used keys
* PopupAnimated finally gets a completely transparent background


## 3.33.0 and 1.33 PySimpleGUI 25-May-2019

* Emergency fix due to debugger.  Old bug was that Image Element was not testing for COLOR_SYSTEM_DEFAULT correctly.


## 3.34.0 PySimpleGUI & 1.34.0 PySimpleGUI27 25-May-2019

  pip rhw  w cenf
* Fixed Window.Maximize and Window.Normal - needed special code for Linux
* Check for DEFAULT_SCROLLBAR_COLOR not being the COLOR_SYSTEM_DEFAULT (crashed)


## 3.35 PySimpleGUI & 1.35 PySimpleGUI27 27-May-2019

* Bug fix - when setting default for Checkbox it was also disabling the element!


## 3.36 PySimpleGUI & 1.36 PySimpleGUI27 29-May-2019

A combination of user requests, and needs of new `imwatchingyou` debugger

* New Debugger Icon for future built-in debugger
* Fixed bug in FindBoundReturnKey - needed to also check Panes
* NEW Window functions to turn on/off the Grab Anywhere feature
    * `Window.GrabAnyWhereOn()`
    * `Window.GrabAnyWhereOff()`
* New "Debugger" button that's built-in like other buttons.  It's a TINY button with a logo. For future use when a debugger is built into PySimpleGUI itself (SOON!)
* Change Text Element Wrap Length calculation.  Went fromn +40 pixels to +10 pixels in formula
* PopupGetFile has new parameter - `multiple_files`. If True then allows selection of multiple files


## 3.37 PySimpleGUI & 1.37 PySimpleGUI27 1-June-2019

* The built-in debugger is HERE - might not WORK exactly yet, but a lot of code went into te PySimpleGUI.py file for this.  At the moment, the `imwatchingyou` package is THE way to use a PySimpleGUI debugger. But soon enough you won't need that project in order to debug your program.
* Some strange code reformatting snuck in.  There are 351 differences between this and previous release.  I'm not sure what happened but am looking at every change by hand.
* New Calendar Button features
    * locale, format - new parameters to TKCalendar call
    * Use custom icon for window if one has been set
    * New parameters to CalendarButton - `locale`, `format`
* The bulk of the built-in PySimpleGUI debugger has been added but is not yet "officially supported".  Try pressing "break" or "ctrl+break" on your keyboard.
    * New bindings for break / pause button and debugger
    * New Debug button will launch debugger.
    * New parameter `debugger_enabled` added to Window call.  Default is __enabled__.
    * Your progam's call to Read is all that's needed to refresh debugger
    * New `Window` methods to control debugger access
        * `EnableDebugger` - turns on HOTKEYS to debugger
        * `DisableDebugger` - turns off HOTKEYS to debugger
* Restored wrap len for Text elements back from +10 to +40 pixels
* `PopupGetFolder`, `PopupGetFile` - fixed so that the "hidden" master window stays hidden (a Linux problem)
* Added support for Multiple Files to `PopupGetFiles` when no_window option has been set.


## 3.38 PySimpleGUI, 1.38 PySimpleGUI27

* Multiline - now has a "read only" state if created as "Disabled"
* Multiline - If window is created as resizable, then Multiline Elements will now expand when the window is enlarged, a feature long asked for.
* Output Element expands in the Y Direction
* "Expandable Rows" option added to PackFormIntoFrame allowing future elements to also expand
* Error Element - silence_on_error option
* Text Element wrapping - FINALLY got it right?  No more "Fudge factor" added
* PopupScrolled - Windows are now resizable
* Option to "launch built-in debugger" from the test harness
* Rememeber that the Debugger is still in this code!  It may or may not be operational as it's one version back from the latest release of the `imwatchingyou` debugger code. This code needs to be integrated back in

## 3.39 PySimpleGUI & 1.39 PySimpleGUI27 13-June-2019

* Ported the imwatchingyou debugger code into PySimpleGUI code
    * Replaced old debugger built-in code with the newer imwatchingyou version
    * Required removing all of the 'sg.' before PySimpleGUI calls since not importing
    * Dynamically create the debugger object when first call to `refresh` or `show` is made
* Started the procecss of renaming Class Methods that are private to start with _
* Needed for the automatic documentation generation that's being worked on
* Fixed crash when clicking the Debug button
* Fixed bug in DeleteFigure. Needed to delete image separately
* Added more type hints
* New `TabGroup` method `SelectTab(index)` selects a `Tab` within a `TabGroup`
* New `Table.Update` parameter - `select_rows`. List of rows to select (0 is first)
* Error checking in `Window.Layout` provides error "hints" to the user
    * Looks for badly placed ']'
    * Looks for functions missing '()'
    * Pops up a window warning user instead of crashing
    * May have to revisit if the popups start getting in the way
* New implementations of `Window.Disable()` and `Window.Enable()`
    * Previously did not work correctly at all
    * Now using the "-disabled" attribute
* Allow Comboboxes to have empty starting values
    * Was crashing
    * Enables application to fill these in later

# 4.0.0 PySimpleGUI & 2.0.0 PySimpleGUI27   19-June-2019

* DOC STRINGS DOCS STRINGS DOC STRINGS!
	* Your IDE is about to become very happy
	* All Elements have actual documentation in the call signature
	* The Readme and ReadTheDocs will be generated going forward using the CODE
	* HUGE Thanks for @nngogol for both copying & adding all those strings, but also for making an entire document creation system.
* New __version__ string for PySimpleGUI.py
* New parameter to ALL `SetFocus` calls. 	
	* def SetFocus(self, force=False)
	* If force is True, then a call to `focus_force` is made instead of `focus_set`
* Get - New Radio Button Method.  Returns True is the Radio Button is set
* Rename of Debugger class to _Debugger so IDEs don't get confused
* User read access to last Button Color set now available via property `Button.ButtonColor`
* Rename of a number of callback handlers to start with _
* Fix for memory leak in Read call. Every call to read lost a little memory due to root.protocol calls
* Listbox.Update - New parameter - scroll_to_index - scroll view so that index is shown at the top
* First PyPI release to use new documentation!

Make suggestions people!  Future release features


## Code Condition

    Make it run
    Make it right
    Make it fast

It's a recipe for success if done right.  PySimpleGUI has completed the "Make it run" phase.  It's far from "right" in many ways.  These are being worked on.  The module is particularly poor for PEP 8 compliance.  It was a learning exercise that turned into a somewhat complete GUI solution for lightweight problems.

While the internals to PySimpleGUI are a tad sketchy, the public interfaces into the SDK are more strictly defined and comply with PEP 8 for the most part.

Please log bugs and suggestions in the GitHub!  It will only make the code stronger and better in the end, a good thing for us all, right?

## Design

A moment about the design-spirit of `PySimpleGUI`.  From the beginning, this package was meant to take advantage of Python's capabilities with the goal of programming ease.

**Single File**
While not the best programming practice, the implementation resulted in a single file solution.  Only one file is needed, PySimpleGUI.py.  You can post this file, email it, and easily import it using one statement.

**Functions as objects**
In Python, functions behave just like object. When you're placing a Text Element into your form, you may be sometimes calling a function and other times declaring an object.  If you use the word Text, then you're getting an object.  If you're using `Txt`, then you're calling a function that returns a `Text` object.

**Lists**
It seemed quite natural to use Python's powerful list constructs when possible.  The form is specified as a series of lists.  Each "row" of the GUI is represented as a list of Elements. When the form read returns the results to the user, all of the results are presented as a single list.  This makes reading a form's values super-simple to do in a single line of Python code.

**Dictionaries**
Want to view your form's results as a dictionary instead of a list... no problem, just use the `key` keyword on your elements.  For complex forms with a lot of values that need to be changed frequently, this is by far the best way of consuming the results.

You can also look up elements using their keys.  This is an excellent way to update elements in reaction to another element.  Call `form.FindElement(key)` to get the Element.

**Named / Optional Parameters**
This is a language feature that is featured **heavily**  in all of the API calls, both functions and classes.  Elements are configured, in-place, by setting one or more optional parameters.  For example, a Text element's color is chosen by setting the optional `text_color` parameter.

**tkinter**
tkinter is the "official" GUI that Python supports.  It runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac.  It was chosen as the first target GUI framework due to its ***ubiquity***.  Nearly all Python installations, with the exception of Ubuntu Linux, come pre-loaded with tkinter.   It is the "simplest" of the GUI frameworks to get up an running (among Qt, WxPython, Kivy, etc).

From the start of the PSG project, tkinter was not meant to be the only underlying GUI framework for PySimpleGUI.  It is merely a starting point.  All journeys begin with one step forward and choosing tkinter was the first of many steps for PySimpleGUI.  Now there are 4 ports up and running - tkinter, WxPython, Qt and Remi (web support)
